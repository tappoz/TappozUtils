This project aggregates some utility classes I wrote over the time.

* org.tappoz.intervals: this package deals with intervals 
  e.g. overlapping, not overlapping, one included in the other, the covered length of a list of intervals, etc.
* org.tappoz.taxamounts: this package deals with progressive tax rates (the problem is solved through recursion)
* org.tappoz.math: this package deals with integers and arrays 
  e.g. finding the first unique value on a given arrays, 
  finding the number of distinct digits on a given integer, 
  finding the number of divisible integers on a given range with a given divisor, etc.

For every class a Unit Test class is provided with tests on expected values and expected Exceptions thrown.
