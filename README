This project aggregates some utility classes I wrote over the time.

* org.tappoz.intervals: this package deals with intervals 
  (overlapping, not overlapping, one included in the other, the covered length of a list of intervals, etc.)
* org.tappoz.taxamounts: this package deals with progressive tax rates (the problem is solved through recursion)

For every class a Unit Test class is provided.
